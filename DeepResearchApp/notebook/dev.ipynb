       "As of November 2025, several AI agent frameworks have emerged, each offering unique capabilities for developing autonomous systems:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Agent Lightning**: A flexible framework enabling reinforcement learning-based training of large language models (LLMs) for any AI agent. It decouples agent execution from training, allowing seamless integration with existing agents and supports complex interaction logic. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03680?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF)**: Utilizes LLMs and mathematical frameworks to guide the design of adaptive AI agents. PCF enables real-time parameter reconfiguration through combinatorial spaces, allowing agents to dynamically adjust their behaviors. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01581?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **GoalfyMax**: A protocol-driven multi-agent system that introduces a standardized Agent-to-Agent communication layer based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It incorporates an Experience Pack architecture for structured knowledge retention and continual learning. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09497?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Cognitive Kernel-Pro**: An open-source, multi-module agent framework designed to democratize the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents. It focuses on curating high-quality training data and enhancing agent robustness through test-time reflection and voting. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00414?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **OpenAI Agents SDK**: A lightweight Python framework released in March 2025, focusing on creating multi-agent workflows with comprehensive tracing and guardrails. It is provider-agnostic, compatible with over 100 different LLMs. ([jlcnews.com](https://www.jlcnews.com/post/the-best-ai-agents-in-2025-tools-frameworks-and-platforms-compared?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**: Announced in April 2025, this modular framework integrates with the Google ecosystem, including Gemini and Vertex AI. It supports hierarchical agent compositions and requires minimal code for efficient development. ([jlcnews.com](https://www.jlcnews.com/post/the-best-ai-agents-in-2025-tools-frameworks-and-platforms-compared?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Microsoft Semantic Kernel**: A lightweight framework bridging traditional development with AI capabilities, emphasizing seamless integration into enterprise applications. It supports multiple languages and orchestrates multi-step AI workflows. ([linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-5-frameworks-building-ai-agents-2025-sahil-malhotra-wmisc?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Microsoft AutoGen**: A flexible toolkit for developing advanced multi-agent systems, simplifying the building of conversational AI and task automation agents. ([linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-5-frameworks-building-ai-agents-2025-sahil-malhotra-wmisc?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Manus**: An autonomous AI agent developed by Butterfly Effect Technology, designed to independently execute complex real-world tasks without continuous human supervision. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_%28AI_agent%29?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Kruti**: A multilingual AI agent and chatbot developed by Ola Krutrim, capable of performing real-world tasks for users by integrating directly with various online services. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruti?utm_source=openai))\n",
