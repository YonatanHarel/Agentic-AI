**Chosen Company: Last Energy**

**Why it was chosen:**
- Last Energy is at the forefront of clean and renewable energy innovation with its focus on developing small modular reactors. This aligns strategically with global energy trends moving towards sustainability and long-term energy solutions. The company's recent successful funding round further validates strong investor confidence and support for its growth trajectory. Furthermore, Last Energy's emphasis on using off-the-shelf parts aids in cost reduction, enhancing its appeal as a scalable business model within the energy sector.

**Companies not selected:**

1. **Robinhood Markets**:
   - While Robinhood has experienced rapid growth and offers potential for short-term gains, it faces significant market volatility and intense competition within the fintech industry. The stock's susceptibility to market fluctuations requires a cautious approach, making it less ideal for investors seeking stability and reliability.

2. **Celestica**:
   - Celestica has shown recent positive performance with its strategic focus on tech services. However, concerns about potential overvaluation limit its appeal. While the company presents a stable investment option, it lacks the explosive market growth and unique long-term appeal that Last Energy offers through its position in the evolving clean energy sector.
